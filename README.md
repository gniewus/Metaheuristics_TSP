### Travel Salesman Problem solved with evolutionary algorithm
#### NetLogo + Java + Tableau

##### Netlogo 
NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. 

###### Controlling API 
NetLogo can be invoked and controlled by another program running on the Java Virtual Machine. For example, you might want to call NetLogo from a small program that does something simple like automate a series of model runs

##### Traveling Salesman Problem 
It asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.
